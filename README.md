##Library Management System

###Overview

The Library Management System is a Python program designed to manage library resources, including books, magazines, and DVDs. The system supports functionalities like adding new items, checking out and returning items, managing overdue fines, and searching for resources. This project is ideal for demonstrating your programming and problem-solving skills to recruiters.


###Features

Resource Management: Add and store details of books, magazines, and DVDs.

Search Functionality: Search for items by title, author, or category.

Checkout & Return: Check out and return items with automatic due date calculations.

Overdue Fine Management: Calculate fines for overdue items.

Dynamic Display: View all available and checked-out resources with their statuses.


###How It Works

Add Resources: Input details (title, author, category) of new items to the library.

Search Resources: Use keywords to search for specific items.

Manage Checkouts: Check out an item and assign a due date (default: 14 days).

Return Items: Return items and handle overdue fines.

Display Items: View a list of all library items with their availability status.


###Usage

Clone or download the project to your local machine.

Open the project folder in your favorite code editor (e.g., VS Code).

Ensure all files (main.py, library.py, library_item.py) are in the same folder.

Run the main.py file using Python:

python main.py

Interact with the system through the text-based menu.
